# hackathon-2
This project is called as the Library Reservation System. Our motto is to blid a website which is focused on the time-saving and easy-to-use for th users who are looking to borrow a book from the library. This will basically make sure that the book you desired will be available and reserved for you incase you want it. In our website each book will have the following sections:
1. Book name
2. Author name
3. Availability(Yes or no)
5. No.of copies
6. Cover photo
7. Reserve button(if book is available otherwise it'll show unavailable)
   
These are the sections that can be seen/ accessed by the users.
By successful reservation the users will get a system generated reciept which they can print and submit it on the library for their required book.


There is also a admin account with which you can add, delete and also edit the names of the books, authors, copies and the cover photo. Basically you can control everything from the admin account.
